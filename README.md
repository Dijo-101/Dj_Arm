# Robotic Arm


This is a simple project created using arduino nano,servo motors and potentiometers.


This code allows an Arduino to control a robotic claw or arm based on user input from potentiometers.The servos adjust their positions in real-time according to the potentiometer settings, allowing for intuitive control of the robotic mechanism. The use of mapping and conditional statements provides flexibility in controlling the claw and joints based on the input from the user.

Components used: Arduino nano, Potentiomemeter(*4), Servo Motor(*4), Breadboard, Jumper Wire.
